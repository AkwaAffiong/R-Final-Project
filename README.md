# Infertility After Induced and Spontaneous Abortion

This package uses functions to conduct basic data analysis of infertility after cases of either induced or spontaneous abortions. This package also visualizes abortion cases based on age.


## Motivation
I have a deep passion for women's health, and infertility as well as abortions are aspects of it. I decided to make use of this data to give the opportunity to learn a new skill (R package building) while indulging myself in a topic I care about.
## Functions
I made used of five functions for this package. The first is a print function which prints out the word spontaneous when it reads the number 1, and unspontaneous when it reads a number that is not 1. The next two functions are scatterplot functions. The first scatterplot function generates a scatterplot graph with a regression line that plots age versus spontaneous abortions. The second scatterplot function does the same for induced abortions. The fourth function creates a subset dataset, from the original dataset, using people who are under 25 years old. The last function conducts a basic statistical analysis of the age variable in the dataset, generating the mean, median, variance, minimum, and maximum.
## Conclusion
Creating this package was a journey for me, both educationally and emotionally. I learned so much, and have come far as someone with no background in computer science or programming. A year ago from today, I never thought that I would be coding. From the struggle to fix an error in a code to the joy when my code generates a successful output, I am grateful for it all. This is my first R package, and I do not think it will be my last.
